# DinerPhilosopher

## Problem
<p>The pthread library provides the pthread mutex structure to enable easy mutual exclusion. Design a counting semaphore structure using mutex called
my semaphore so that multiple pthreads can synchronize access to some limited/shared resource. Note that the counting semaphore should use the signalling mechanism the way semaphores work, i.e. signalling a thread that waits
on a semaphore. Your counting semaphore should implement the primitives
wait(), signal() and signal(printValue) for debugging.
</p>
<p>Use the semaphore you have so defined to solve the following modified version
of dining philosopher problem. Consider the scenario where you have a similar
case of k philosophers and k forks. But in this case, the dinning table also has a
pair of sauce bowls, both of which are needed simultaneously for a philosopher
to eat. Write a program that simulates the philosophers using threads, and
the resources (forks and sauce bowls) using a shared variable. Your simulation
should print the following message on the console whenever a philosopher gets
to eat: ”Philosopher < thread id > eats using forks < fork no x > and <
fork no y >. The simulation keeps running in an infinite loop. Then, use
my semaphore to avoid any possible deadlocks. You may also implement nonblocking variants of wait() and signal() using the non-blocking functions
available in the Pthreads library. </p>
